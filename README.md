# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project is focused on building a **machine learning model** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data. It aims to help prevent financial fraud using advanced **classification algorithms** and **data preprocessing techniques**.

---

## 📌 Overview

Fraudulent transactions are rare and often difficult to detect. This system uses **imbalanced data handling**, **feature scaling**, and **classification models** such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost to accurately predict fraudulent activity.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🔄 Preprocessing (scaling, missing value handling)
- ⚖️ Imbalanced dataset techniques (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling)
- 🤖 ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- 📈 Model evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
- 📉 Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- XGBoost

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**: The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with 284,807 transactions and 492 frauds.
